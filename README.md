Requirements
General Requirements
This is a solo project!
Just to clarify, you may do the same game as another student, but you may not work together
This game cannot be a game or assignment we've already done in class
This game must run in a web browser
This game must be tracked in Github, with a minimum on 10 commits
Ideally, put your empty project up on Github on day one of development and aim for multiple commits per day
This game must be deployed on Github Pages or another location
Game Requirements
This game can be designed for 2 or more players (PvP) or 1 player (PvE)
The second player in a PvP game can be a person or an AI
For multi-player games, turns should switch appropriately between players
This game should be winnable or it should keep score (whichever makes more sense)
When a player wins or loses, the game status and/or score should display visually to the player in a way that does not rely on console.logs or alerts
If there is a valid draw (tie) condition in your chosen game, that should be implemented
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should live in separate files
Effort must be spent on styling and appearance
The HTML code should use sematic tags
The game should have a Readme.md file in the Github repository that describes the inspiration for the game, explains the controls and how to play the game, lists the technologies used to build the game, and addresses any outstanding bugs or unfinished functionality
Bonus Ideas
Make persistent scores in your browser's localStorage
Add interesting music or sound effects to your game
Deliverables
A link to your game, which is deployed somewhere on the internet
A link to your Github repository, so we can see the progress on your game


As you can see, she didn't get a 3 or higher in every individual area, but she scored high enough in other areas that she is more than passing.

Grade Interpretations
We're expecting that these milestone projects are going to be candidates for portfolio pieces that you may want to show off on a personal site or to a potential employer as a code example. You should assume any project with a limited time frame will need to be cleaned up, refactored, and DRYed out at a later time before it's ready to show others. Take note of code style improvements, commonly requested feature additions, and other suggestions to make your project the most impressive.

In the end, the project boils down to a pass/fail grade - either you score 15 or above or you don't. The scoring system is a nuance to help you understand your feedback and how your project will be perceived by potential employers and other industry professionals. The closer the score is to 25, the closer to ready it is to be a portfolio project. The closer to 15 it is, the more polishing up it may need. Pay attention to areas where you scored 4 or lower and make sure you understand why.

Non-Passing Projects
If your project is scored at 14 or below, it is expected that you will be resubmitting at a later due date according to the directions in your syllabus. Please note that there may be a limited number of resubmissions allowed. This information will be relayed to you in writing.

Tips on Getting Started
Thinking like a coder
Up to this point, the concepts you've learned may have seemed academic or theoretical. Now you're actually building a project of your own choosing. For grading purposes, we've set a couple limits and goals for you, but this is generally a "real-life scenario". Don't forget your earlier training.

Break down large tasks into smaller ones
Pseudocode!
Consider how you will store data associated with your game
Remember that time spent planning pays dividends!
Set up GitHub at the start
Even though you don't have anything to put into it yet, start out by making an empty git repository and then do all your work in there. Aim for multiple commits per day, ideally after you finish any small feature. Also, consider making an outline for your `readme.md` file as part of your planning process.

Commit early! Commit often!
Use those developer tools
Use console.log, alert, breakpoints, the inspector, and the debugger to get a glimpse of what's going on in your code. Know where to look to find errors and get used to interpreting common ones!

Know your documentation & sources
There are many places you can look for help and documentation:

Mozilla Developer Networkâ€“ Documentation on JavaScript
jQuery- Documentation on jQuery if you choose to use it
MDN: CSS Reference- Documentation on CSS
W3Schools- Reference for HTML, CSS, and JS
CSS Tricks - A CSS Reference containing more advanced CSS topics
